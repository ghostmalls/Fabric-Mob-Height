# Fabric Mob Heights

A lightweight Fabric mod that introduces subtle, realistic height differences while staying true to vanilla gameplay. Inspired by [Variable Mob Height](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vmh), reimagined for Fabric 1.20.1. Fully customizable via Mod Menu.

## üéØ Features

 - Realistic size variations reflecting natural animal proportions
 - Persistent mob scaling through NBT data   
 - Compatibility with mods & resource packs
 - Customizable scaling ranges via Mod Menu
 - Dynamic adjustments to damage and movement speed
 - Player exclusion for balanced gameplay
 - Biome Integration: Mob sizes adapt to their environment

## üîß Technical Details

- Leverages Pehkui API for smooth scaling implementation
- Maintains door compatibility for humanoid entities
- Includes biome and dimension-specific scaling options
- UUID-based scale caching system
- Periodic cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Configurable through Mod Menu (Game restart required for most options to take affect)
- Simple /resize <size> and /resize undo commands for OPs

## üåç Biome Scaling System

The mod dynamically adjusts mob sizes based on their spawn biome. Each biome has unique scaling factors that affect mob sizes in logical ways. Modded biomes use a default 1.0x multiplier, while biomes that share categories with vanilla biomes automatically inherit their vanilla counterparts' scaling factors.

| Desert | 1.2x (20% larger) | Adaptation to open terrain |
| Plains | 1.0x (baseline) | Standard reference size |
| Swamp | 0.8x (20% smaller) | Dense vegetation adaptation |
| Mountains | 1.15x (15% larger) | Higher altitude adaptation |
| Forest | 0.9x (10% smaller) | Forest canopy adaptation |
| Savanna | 1.1x (10% larger) | Open grassland adaptation |
| Tundra | 1.2x (20% larger) | Cold climate adaptation |
| Beach | 0.85x (15% smaller) | Coastal environment adaptation |
| Ocean | 1.25x (25% larger) | Aquatic environment adaptation |
